        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
          <p>The artist is the talent of the generation, with a modern twist and flair seen in his work, it is very unique. Born in Austria, the upbringing in the mountains influenced him from a young age, then when he moved the industrial districts of Detroit in his angsty adolescent years, the true modern art phase began. You can see the influences in the work, buy some before all inspiration dries out.</p>
